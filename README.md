By reviewing the file and working on the data cleaning and analysis as requested. I'll clean the data, split the name data, ensure opt-in status, and then proceed with the analysis, including the running total of funds raised.



#Initial data Analysis:

The dataset includes the following columns:

•	Full name, Campaign Name, Status, Recurrence, Currency, Amount, Running total, Gift Aid, Opt in, Source, Medium , Campaign, Donation date.

Data Cleaning:

The data has been cleaned as follows:

1.	Name Splitting: The "Full name" column has been split into "First Name" and "Last Name."
2.	Opt-in Filtering: Only donors who opted in to hear from the organization are retained. 

 

3.	By Converting all donation amounts to USD using current exchange 
rates, Sort the data by donation date & Calculate the running total of funds raised.

 

The data has been successfully converted to USD, sorted by donation date, and the running total of funds raised has been calculated.

#THE FINDINGS

A short report with insights, predictions, and recommendations for reaching the campaign target of 1.5 million USD. This report will summarize the key findings, trends, and offer suggestions for future actions.

Campaign Progress Report

1. Overview of the Fundraising Campaign

The fundraising campaign has been progressing steadily, with donations collected from various sources and in different currencies. After converting all amounts to USD and calculating the running total, the campaign has accumulated a significant sum. However, further efforts are needed to reach the target of 1.5 million USD.

2. Key Findings

•	Total Amount Raised (USD): The campaign has raised approximately 
$ 582277.61 USD as of the last recorded donation .
•	Daily Donations: The donations are recorded over multiple days, with varying amounts contributed each day. The highest single donation observed in the sample was $63.0 USD.
•	Currency Conversion Impact: The donations were received in GBP, EUR, and USD. After conversion, the total reflects the equivalent amount in USD.

3. Trends & Insights
•	Opt-in Rate: The dataset indicates that a portion of the donors opted to hear from the organization, allowing for follow-up and engagement, which is crucial for future fundraising efforts.
•	Source of Donations: Instagram appears to be a significant medium for donations, particularly for the "All Eyes on Gaza" campaign.

4. Predictions and Recommendations
•	Current Status: With the running total at around $130 thousand USD, the campaign is far from its target. To meet the 1.5 million USD target, the organization must strategize to significantly increase the daily donation rate.
•	Donor Engagement: Focus on engaging donors who have opted in, as they are more likely to contribute again. Sending targeted communications and updates about the campaign’s impact may encourage repeat donations.
•	Campaign Optimization: Consider amplifying the most successful channels (like Instagram) and explore new avenues for reaching potential donors. Additionally, increasing visibility and urgency as the campaign progresses could help boost donations.

5. Conclusion

The campaign has a promising start, but achieving the 1.5 million USD goal will require increased effort in donor engagement, channel optimization, and possibly additional fundraising events or activities. It’s crucial to maintain momentum and keep donors informed and motivated to contribute.

Estimated Time to Reach Target:
•	If donations continue at the current average rate, it would take about 75,000 more donations to reach the $1.5 million target.
•	Assuming a consistent rate of donations, it might take months to reach the target unless the campaign is intensified.
